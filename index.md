## About Me

I am a postdoc researcher in <a target="_blank" href="https://appliedmath.brown.edu/"><autocolor>Division of Applied Mathematics</autocolor></a> at Brown University. I got my Ph.D. at Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées de l'Ecole Polytechnique (CMAP), where I was part of <a target="_blank" href="https://team.inria.fr/tropical/"><autocolor>Optimix</autocolor></a>.


## Research Interests

I study mixed integer linear and nonlinear programming, with a special interest in decomposition and cutting plane methods. My primary research goal is to develop and implement efficient algorithms for optimization software systems (notably the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scipopt.org/"><autocolor>SCIP solver</autocolor></a>), and I mostly use C++ and Julia. My research codes are usually publicly available on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lidingxu?tab=repositories"><autocolor>github repositories</autocolor></a>.
