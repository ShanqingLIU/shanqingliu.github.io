## About Me

I am a postdoc researcher in <a target="_blank" href="https://appliedmath.brown.edu/"><autocolor>Division of Applied Mathematics</autocolor></a> at Brown University. I got my Ph.D. at Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées de l'Ecole Polytechnique (CMAP), where I was part of <a target="_blank" href="https://team.inria.fr/tropical/"><autocolor>TROPICAL</autocolor></a> Team.


## Research Interests

I study optimal control and optimization, with a special interest in the Dynamic Programming Principle based approach and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. 
I developed numerical schemes to mitigate the curse-of-dimensionality (CoD) in this approach. 
I also worked on boradly numerical optimal control and optimizations, and efficient numerical solvers for PDEs with a motivation from the optimization point of view. 
More recently, I am particular interested in the interactions between control, optimization and problems arising from scientific machine learning.
