## About Me

I am a postdoc researcher in <a target="_blank" href="https://appliedmath.brown.edu/"><autocolor>Division of Applied Mathematics</autocolor></a> at Brown University. I got my Ph.D. at Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées de l'Ecole Polytechnique (CMAP), where I was part of <a target="_blank" href="https://team.inria.fr/tropical/"><autocolor>TROPICAL</autocolor></a> Team.


## Research Interests

I study optimal control and optimization, with a particular focus on the Dynamic Programming Principle and the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. 
My research includes the development of numerical schemes aimed at mitigating the curse of dimensionality inherent in this approach. 
I have also worked broadly on numerical methods for optimal control and optimization, as well as on the design of efficient numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs), motivated by optimization perspectives.
More recently, my interests have shifted toward the interplay between control, optimization, and challenges in scientific machine learning.
